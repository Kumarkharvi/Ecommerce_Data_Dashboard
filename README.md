# Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

• Created a small Interactive Dashboard to Analyse Monthly Sales profit and loss corresponding to the regions.

• Here I used a Small chunk of VBA code to make a Product details drop-down list to select Products to analyze the Sales according to that.

• Used Pivot Tables to summarize the data for easy analysis.

• Accomplished this Project in 2 hours.
